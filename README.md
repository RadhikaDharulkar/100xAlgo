# 100xAlgo
This Project makes use of the Parallel processing functionality of elixir.  It runs an algorithm many times(say 100) for different values of input size(in parallel) and obtain the running times for different input sizes. An algorithm will run a 100 times in parallel so that we don't have to wait for it to finish running once, to start it again. What we obtain from this is a data set of the running times for different values of input sizes. We can use this data set to plot a graph and study the algorithm better.  This Project makes use of 2 very basic sorting algorithms to demonstrate its working.
